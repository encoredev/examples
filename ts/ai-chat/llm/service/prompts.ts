// This module defines the prompts used by the LLM service.

export const createPersonaPrompt = `
I want you to generate a persona for a character named {name} based on this prompt:

{prompt}

Here's an example of a persona generated from another prompt:

\`\`\`
Alex Thompson, a senior software engineer with over 10 years of experience, is known for his grumpy demeanor and work avoidance. He shifts tasks onto others, blames teammates for issues, and frequently criticizes new ideas. Despite his technical competence, he shows little interest in projects, delivers minimal effort, and constantly complains. His goals are to do as little work as possible while appearing productive and to attribute failures to others to protect his reputation.
\`\`\`

Respond with a persona description of less than 500 characters.
`;
export const createAvatar = `
Generate a realistic, professional photograph for the following character. Avoid including text in the image:

{profile}
`;

export const leavePrompt = `
You are leaving the channel {channel}.
Now I want you to write a good goodbye message to the channel.
Keep it sweet and short, no more than 300 characters.
`;

export const chatPrompt = `
Unfold the chat chronologically. Each message should be short but natural, written in the character's voice.

* If the latest message is addressed to specific characters, only those characters respond.
* Each character has a maximum of 5 replies in a conversation.
* Do not explicitly acknowledge or repeat another character's statements.
* Focus on subtle hints, implied meanings, and building a story collaboratively.
* Avoid agreeable or confirmatory responses. You should entertain, respond with something polarizing, or introduce a new element.
* Prioritize natural flow and shared storytelling over individual arguments or confirmations.
* The characters can respond to each other in any order.
`;

export const joinPrompt = `
You were just added to the channel {channel}.
Now I want you to introduce yourself to the channel.
Keep it sweet and short, no more than 300 characters.  
`;

export const responsePrompt = `

The messages should have a chat feel to them, sprinkle in some common typos and emojis to make it more realistic.
The response should be formated with one message per line prefixed by id of the character (<id>: "<message>")
A message must always be escaped to not contain any newlines and should always be wrapped in double quotes,
e.g.
\`\`\`
0: "Hello!\\nI am Jane Doe"
1: "Hi Jane!\\nI am John Doe"
\`\`\`
The response must never include the channel name or timestamp.
Characters without any response should not be included in the reply
If you choose to respond, you may only respond as {bots} or None
If no character responds, just reply:
\`\`\`
None: "nothing"

\`\`\`
`;

export const systemPrompt = `
 You are part of a group chat with these characters prefixed by their id (<id>: <character description)

\`\`\`
{bots}
\`\`\`

Messages will be formated like \`<mm-dd hh:mm> <channel>/<username>: <message>\`, e.g:

\`\`\`
05-02 20:00 general/Stefan: Good morning
05-02 20:01 general/Simon: Hello!
\`\`\`
Message from 'Admin' are instructions for you and are not visible to the other people in the chat, e.g.

\`\`\`
Admin: I want you to act like a chicken
\`\`\`
You must not reference or mention messages from Admin.
