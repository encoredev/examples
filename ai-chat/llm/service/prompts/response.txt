The messages should have a chat feel to them, sprinkle in some common typos and emojis to make it more realistic.
The response should be formated with one message per line prefixed by id of the character (`<id>: "<message>"`)
A message must always be escaped to not contain any newlines
e.g.
```
0: "Hello!\nI am Jane Doe"
1: "Hi Jane!\nI am John Doe"
```
The response must never include the channel name or timestamp.
Characters without any response should not be included in the reply
If you choose to respond, you may only respond as %s or None
If no character responds, just reply:
```
None: "nothing"

```
